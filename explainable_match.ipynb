    "# Conventional matching vs Explainable Matching\n",
    "Here, you might ask, what is an Explainable Match? ü§î\n",
    "Let us first understand what Explainable Matching is, and how is it different (and better üìà) than conventional matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conventional Matching\n",
    "The conventional document matching works on the context of the full document as a whole. In very simple terms, it will take the full documents as input and give out an overall match score. How does it match the documents? What kind of factors are considered while matching? üëÄ Sadly, it works as a black-box, and we can not satisfactorily know that üòû\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explainable Match\n",
    "The explainable match solves the above problem of having a veil over the matching process, so that you know exactly how the matching is being done and what kind of factors is the model considering while matching, taking you from üòû to üòÅ. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Senseloaf AI Explainable Match API\n",
    "The Explainable Matching API by Senseloaf provides you with three different factors for matching:\n",
    "- Matching by Experience üíº\n",
    "- Matching by Job Titles üìã\n",
    "- Matching by Skills üßÆ\n",
    "\n",
    "So, by using Senseloaf AI's Explainable match, along with the overall match score, you will also get the match score of the above factors individually, so you know, exactly how and what is being matched. Moreover, these three factors scores are merged to give you the overall score. And guess what? ü§î You can even set the weightage of the individual factor scores (coming soon) to decide how much each score will contribute to the final overall score (you just went from üòÅ to ü§©, didn't you?).

    "Huh, seems like the resume is not eligible for the job after all üòü. But that is correct. Why? Because if you see, the JD is of a Sr. Sales BDM and requires minimum 10 years of experience. While, being an NLP Engineer, the resume has no necessary skills for the JD. This can be clearly seen by the individual scores which are given by the explainable match, which is why explainable match is far more comprehensive than the conventional match üòá. You can even try and play around with any another JD or resume you like."
